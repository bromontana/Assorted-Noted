# Wireless Ideation Session

collaborative ideation is a game between absurdity and brilliance?

## Ideation Process 

"taking an idea an making it into something of value"


FIRE: 

1. Focus
    + Thoroughly identifying a problem. 
    + can be broken into 4 sections: 
        + Questions: If you can formulate an unanswered question, 
it could be a wedge into innovation. 
        + Assumptions: Being disruptive and challenging assumptions
can at times be a way to innovate in the future. 
        + Problems: A properly defined problem is the best way to 
finding it's solution
        + Opportunities: Opportunities need to be capitalized on early,
and we need to always be identifying these as 
EARLY as possible

4. Execution

## Breakout (Problems (1) and Opportunities (2)) 

 + Aging Society
    1) People are aging and want to be comfortable; Old people do not 
want to be watched or detoured by the machine overlords;
    2) Interactive home Automated "nanny" for old people; Old people want
to have better connectivity to family; in home health evaluations 

 + Autonomous Systems (AI)
    1) Distrust in AI due to old stereotypes (war games); 
    2) 

 + Connected World (more social network like) 
    1) Phishing; 
    2) All new platforms will have to adress communications is VERY specific
ways (ex.no more Facebook, but maybe something else that 
connects people will come up) 

 + Outer-net (augmented systems, internet of things?)
    1) Security Distrust; Platform dependance/vertical stacking; 
    2) better traffic; better physical security

 + Distrust Society
    1) Cryptocurrenies; adoption;
    2) Also cryptocurrencies; Making more "human" interactions 

 + Shy-Tech (ambient technology) 
    1) Trust problems; "big brother" mentality; failures could be terrible
    2) technology that will passively work to improve quality of life; 

 + Emerging Technologies (CL specific) 
    1) 
    2)
