# Strength Finder

I have skills that were identified by the gallop poll I took and 
learned some stuff. 

## My strength skills #top5

Here they are: 

 + Restorative: Adept at dealing with problems. Good at figuring out 
what is wrong and resolving it.
 + Adaptability: Prefer to "go with the flow." Tend to be "no" people
who take things as they come and discover the future one day at a time. 
 + Strategic: Create alternative ways to proceed. Can quickly spot the
relevant patterns and issues. 
 + Learner: Have great desire to learn and want to improve. The process 
of learning is what excites them.
 + Arranger: Can organize, but also have a flexibility that compliments 
that ability. Like to figure out how all of the pieces and resources 
can be arranged for maximum productivity. 


## Story that showcases these

I have always enjoyed cooking and I believe this may encompass most of 
my strengths, but more specifically exemplify the adaptability and 
learner traits. I always enjoyed making new dishes and figuring out 
what has worked and what has not.
