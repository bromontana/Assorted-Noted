## Culture

This s basically a fancy people and technical people retreat so absolutely 
respect everyone's privacy as much as possible, but DO NOT allow this to 
limit networking! 

There is going to be a lot of established companies AS WELL AS start ups
so try and get in on the conversation if possible to really understand
how the startups pitch a group like this and where they do well and 
where they fail. 

*This is a friendly place so if someone tells a joke feel free to LaUgh* 

## Startups 

Up Ramp: this is going to be a series of pitches from start ups and cool 
new innovators. 

[TekStadium is a thing](https://www.tekstadium.com/) and I need to understand it better.

### Fiterator

This is the startup accelerator that cable labs backs. Because it takes 
20-30 months to get contracts with cable vendors, Fiterator is aimed at 
getting those startups to actually make it to the industry.

### Innovation Showcase 

This is going to be where startups go and pitch ideas to panels and the 
audience to see how it is received. 

### Startup Valley

This is going to be an expo-styled exhibit thing where startups can just 
stand there and wait for us to come and pass judgement upon them.
