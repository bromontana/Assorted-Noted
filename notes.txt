fun @ CL 

hack autism

started 13 startups 
    cashed out on the 13th one


innovation= looking at different problems differently 
            largely has to do with background (non technical sense, so upbringing, etc.) 
            ideas come from biases (continuation of one before) 


strengthfinders/roundpegg for making better rounded teams


**culture**


Phil has a guest house in Rowanda for outreach work that could be fun 


Questions: 
            how to handle teams at seperate locations
                no complete team can be attached to a location: if there are two 
                locations, have a team split across both


            Growth(?)(this is about the growth he spearheaded at CL) 
                133 -> ~200+
                130 people > 90 projects at the begininng: now 35 projects
                establish the role first: members do not need 0-3 years out technology, that is tech evaluations
                cable labs is that 5+ years out predictor. This is how they establish their edge


            Will we get to the point where information (internet) is global?
                ezpz. it's hard now but we will ge there 


            Where do you see cable in 5-10-20 years 
                1) Soon there will be a couple multinational breakouts 
                2) Content price currently increases at 8-12% per year and comcast can only 
                   pass along 4% to the consumers without riots. Content providers need to change 
                   how the buisness model works 
                3) The cable industry is going to 100% move to a more data service centric packages


            Does cable hate Netflix?
                HECk nu
                when someone switches over they often need to pay for more data service, which is
                much more popular


            Wartime/Peacetime CXO responsibilities 


            How do interns fit into this master plan? 
                reverse mentoring: getting the employees to learn from the yoyung peoples
